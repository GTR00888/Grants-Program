Project Overview

Overview

Tagline
An open attestation and proof framework for verifiable project information in the Polkadot ecosystem.

A brief description of your project
This project delivers an attestation and proof framework that enables structured identity and governance attestations and generates Merkle based proofs that can be verified in Substrate compatible environments.
The work includes attestation schemas, validation rules, a Merkle proof generator, a Substrate compatible anchoring example and a verification tool.
The project does not provide a registry, trust indicators or a hosted verification service.

Relation to Substrate and Polkadot
The framework integrates through Substrate compatible anchoring examples and proof verification routines.

Why your team is interested
The team has researched project verification models and identified the need for open specifications and reproducible proof methods.

Ecosystem Fit

Where and how the project fits
This work provides attestation and proof primitives required by explorers, audit tools and parachain teams.

Target audience
Parachain developers
Wallet developers
Indexers and explorers
Security and audit teams
Developers preparing verifiable project data

Needs addressed
There is no consistent attestation standard for project level information.
There is no open proof mechanism for verifying project supplied data.
Security incidents show losses caused by unverifiable disclosures.

Evidence
Industry analysis and regulatory publications highlight the need for verifiable disclosures.
Developer discussions show demand for consistent verification patterns.

Similar projects
Identity pallets exist but do not support application level attestations or Merkle based proof systems.

Related ecosystems
Other ecosystems offer audits but not attestation formats or proof primitives.
